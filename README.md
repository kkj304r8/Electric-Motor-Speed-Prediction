# Data Science Project: Electric-Motor-Speed-Prediction

The primary goal of this project is to predict motor speed based on various sensor measurements from a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). The dataset, collected from a test bench at Paderborn University, includes multiple measurement sessions tracking motor behavior under varying conditions.
