1. Loaded and inspected the dataset to understand its structure, including missing values and data types.
2. Performed EDA to uncover patterns and relationships between features.
3. Preprocessed the data, including scaling features, and creating training/test splits.
4. Trained multiple predictive models to estimate motor speed.
5. Evaluated model performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE and R-squared.
6. Deployed the best models (MLP and Random Forest) using Streamlit.
