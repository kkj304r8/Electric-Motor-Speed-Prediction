The dataset contains 998,070 rows and 13 columns.
Each row represents one snapshot of sensor data at a certain time step. 
The sample rate is 2 Hz (one record per 0.5 seconds).
Each measurement session (between one and six hours long) is unique and identified by 'profile_id', ensuring session independence.

Feature Set:
1. Environmental Conditions:
a) ambient (temperature near stator)
b) coolant (coolant outflow temperature)

2. Voltage and Current Inputs:
a) u_d and u_q (voltage components)
b) i_d and i_q (current components)

3. Temperature Measurements:
a) pm (permanent magnet surface temperature)
b) stator_yoke
c) stator_tooth
d) stator_winding

4. profile_id (session ID for distinguishing measurements)

5. torque.

Target variable:
1. motor_speed
